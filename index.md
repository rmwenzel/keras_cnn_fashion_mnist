This project trains a custom CNN on the [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset, either locally or in the cloud using Amazon SageMaker.

There are two stages:

1. [Explore Fashion MNIST dataset and CNN model]({{site.baseurl}}/explore_data_and_model)
2. [Train, tune and test the CNN]({{site.baseurl}}/train_tune_test)

The CNN is written with Keras and Tensorflow backend. Generic and Fashion MNIST specific-versions are implemented as custom classes. Notebooks and code can be found in the [repo](https://github.com/rmwenzel/keras_cnn_fashion_mnist).
